[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a PhD student in the Department of Sociology. I hold an MA in Sociology from the University of Leipzig and a BA in Social Sciences and Computer Science from the University of Bern.\nMy PhD research, supervised by Prof Ulf Liebe and Dr Andreas Murr, focuses on the online community Wikipedia. I am interested in the effects offline gatherings between Wikipedians have on their online behaviour, in particular in regard to their contribution, norm-enforcing and voting behaviour in the context of their social network. This research project is partly funded by a Wikimedia Project Grant.\nBesides my PhD research, I have also been working on topics regarding social status and prosociality, ethnic violence, and using web data in the social sciences. I have been working with Oxfam GB and their impact evaluation team to support them in exploring how to use digital data, in particular on Twitter, for impact evaluations.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e641a896d14a4f901cef0389ad2d0a57","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD student in the Department of Sociology.
