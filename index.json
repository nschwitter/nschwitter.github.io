This research project is partly funded by a Wikimedia Project Grant.\nBesides my PhD research, I have also been working on topics regarding social status and prosociality, ethnic violence, and using web data in the social sciences. I have been working with Oxfam GB and their impact evaluation team to support them in exploring how to use digital data, in particular on Twitter, for impact evaluations.\nSend me an email to get in touch: nicole.schwitter.1@warwick.ac.uk.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e641a896d14a4f901cef0389ad2d0a57","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at the University of Warwick.
